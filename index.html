		<h1>This is <em>still</em> a motherfucking website. </h1>
<!-- COMMENT : the beacon em is used almost as the beacon strong, to inform the navigator that text is important ; it will be often displayed in italics -->
		<p>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</p>
	</header>

	<h2>Seriously, its takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h2>
	<p><strong>7 fucking declarations.</strong><br />
	That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="motherfucking_website.html">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it <em>still</em> has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Shit's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li>
		<li><em>Still</em> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
		<li><em>Still</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
		<li>The motherfucker's <em>still</em> accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
		<li>Shit's <em>still</em> legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
	<p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. <a href="https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/42537647/well-go-get-some-glasses-you-son-of-a-bitch.jpg">Here's how.</a></p>

	<h2>Let it breathe</h2>
	<p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum <code>line-height: 1.4</code> for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can'ts see that... piss off.<br />
<!-- COMMENT : the beacon code introduce a line of code without any styling, displaying it raw -->
	If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.</p>

	<h2>A little less contrast</h2>
	<p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made thise site's backgound a nice <code>#EEEEEE</code> id I wasn't focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.

	<h2>Size Matters</h2>
	<p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.</p>

	<h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>
	<p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>

	<h3>Yes, this is <em>also</em> fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
	<p>I love what the creator of <a href="motherfucking_website.html">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
